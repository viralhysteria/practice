A random assortment of projects I did over the years in no particular order before I took
my extended break from coding entirely due to significant mental health issues.

Most of these projects are going to be from tutorials I was following from Traversy Media on YouTube (so mostly web dev).

A large majority of these projects are either very barebones, some may even be broken from me trying to "play around"
with the code, which is something I was also struggling with at the time. I tried to do my best with naming, but
in all honesty - I likely can't remember what half of these are supposed to do, and I can't imagine
a lot of them are commented out; considering they were follow-alongs.

Overall, this repo primarily serves as a "burst of life" for my github, consider it akin to me standing on the
corner of the street, waving my arms while I proclaim "hey, I actually can code a bit!
look!"; a participation badge, if you will.
I talk a lot about reading/writing code but there's not much of *anything* to show for it with
 my current git state because I normally don't expect anyone to care about practice projects.

You won't find any groundbreaking code, easter eggs, etc. here.
